[0:00:00]  When I was a kid, the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war. That's why we had

[0:00:25]  a barrel like this down in our basement filled with cans of food and water. When the nuclear

[0:00:31]  attack came, we were supposed to go down stairs, hunker down and eat out of that barrel.

[0:00:38]  Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn't look like this. Instead, it looks like

[0:00:46]  this. If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely

[0:00:55]  to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war.

[0:01:01]  missiles but microbes. Now part of the reason for this is that we have invested a huge amount

[0:01:09]  in nuclear deterrence, but we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.

[0:01:16]  We're not ready for the next epidemic. Let's look at Ebola. I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper.

[0:01:26]  Lots of tough challenges. I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools we used to track polio eradication.

[0:01:36]  And as you look at what went on, the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough.

[0:01:43]  The problem was that we didn't have a system at all. In fact, there are some pretty obvious key missing pieces.

[0:01:51]  We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go who would have gone, seen what the disease was,

[0:01:58]  see how far it had spread.

[0:02:00]  The case was not the case.

[0:02:01]  These reports came in on paper.

[0:02:03]  I was very delayed before they were put online

[0:02:05]  and they were extremely inaccurate.

[0:02:08]  We didn't have a medical team ready to go.

[0:02:10]  We didn't have a way of preparing people.

[0:02:13]  Now, medicine, some frontiers did a great job

[0:02:16]  orchestrating volunteers, but even so,

[0:02:19]  we were far slower than we should have been

[0:02:21]  getting the thousands of workers into these countries.

[0:02:25]  And a large epidemic would require us to have

[0:02:28]  hundreds of thousands of workers.

[0:02:33]  There was no one there to look at treatment approaches.

[0:02:38]  No one to look at the diagnostics.

[0:02:39]  No one to figure out what tools should be used.

[0:02:43]  As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors,

[0:02:46]  processed it, and put that plasma back in people

[0:02:50]  to protect them.

[0:02:52]  But that was never tried.

[0:02:54]  So there was a lot that was missing.

[0:02:56]  And these things are really a global failure.

[0:03:00]  The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about.

[0:03:07]  Now in the movies, it's quite different.

[0:03:09]  There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go.

[0:03:14]  They move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood.

[0:03:22]  The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola.

[0:03:30]  Let's look at the progression of Ebola over this year.

[0:03:36]  About 10,000 people died and nearly all were in the three bus African countries.

[0:03:43]  There's three reasons why it didn't spread more.

[0:03:46]  The first is there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers.

[0:03:50]  They found the people and they prevented more infections.

[0:03:54]  The second is the nature of the virus.

[0:03:56]  Ebola does not spread through the air and by the

[0:04:00]  time you're contagious, most people are so sick that they're bedridden. Third, it didn't

[0:04:08]  get into many urban areas, and that was just luck. If it got into a lot more urban areas,

[0:04:15]  the case numbers would have been much larger. So next time we might not be so lucky, you

[0:04:21]  can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious that they get on

[0:04:27]  a plane or they go to a market. The source of the virus could be a natural, up-and-amic

[0:04:32]  like Ebola or it could be bioterism. And so there are things that would literally make

[0:04:37]  things a thousand times worse. In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through

[0:04:44]  the air like the Spanish flu back in 1918. So here's what would happen. It would spread

[0:04:52]  throughout the world very, very quickly. And you can see there's over 30 million people

[0:04:58]  die from that epidemic.

[0:04:59]  So this is a serious problem.

[0:05:02]  We should be concerned.

[0:05:04]  But in fact, we can build a really good response system.

[0:05:08]  We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here.

[0:05:13]  We've got cell phones to get information from the public and get information out to them.

[0:05:17]  We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving.

[0:05:21]  We have advances in biology that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen

[0:05:27]  and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen.

[0:05:33]  So we can have tools, but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system

[0:05:38]  and we need preparedness.

[0:05:41]  The best lessons, I think, on how to get prepared are again what we do for war.

[0:05:46]  For soldiers, we have full time waiting to go.

[0:05:50]  We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers.

[0:05:53]  A NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly.

[0:05:57]  NATO does a lot of war games to check our

[0:06:01]  people well-trained, do they understand about fuel and logistics and the same radio frequencies?

[0:06:07]  So they are absolutely ready to go.

[0:06:10]  So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic.

[0:06:15]  What are the key pieces?

[0:06:17]  First, is we need strong health systems in poor countries.

[0:06:22]  That's where mothers can give birth safely, kids can get all their vaccines, but also where

[0:06:28]  we'll see the outbreak very early on.

[0:06:31]  We need a medical reserve corps, lots of people who have got the training and background

[0:06:36]  who are ready to go with the expertise.

[0:06:39]  And then we need to pair those medical people with the military, taking advantage of the

[0:06:45]  military's ability to move fast to logistics and security areas.

[0:06:50]  Being to do simulations, germgames, not war games, so that we see where the holes are.

[0:06:58]  The last time a germgame was done in the United States was back in 2000.

[0:07:01]  one, and it didn't go so well.

[0:07:04]  So far, the score is germs one, people zero.

[0:07:09]  Finally, we need lots of advanced R&D in areas of vaccines

[0:07:14]  and diagnostics.

[0:07:15]  There are some big breakthroughs, like the Dino Associated

[0:07:18]  Virus, that could work very, very quickly.

[0:07:23]  Now, I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost,

[0:07:26]  but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared

[0:07:29]  to the potential harm.

[0:07:31]  The world-bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu

[0:07:34]  epidemic, global wealth will go down by over $3 trillion.

[0:07:39]  And we'd have millions and millions of deaths.

[0:07:43]  These investments offer significant benefits beyond just

[0:07:46]  being ready for the epidemic.

[0:07:48]  The primary health care, the R&D, those things would reduce

[0:07:51]  global health equity and make the world more just, as well

[0:07:55]  as more safe.

[0:07:57]  So I think this should absolutely be a priority.

[0:08:01]  There's no need to worry.

[0:08:03]  No need to panic, we don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement.

[0:08:09]  But we need to get going because time is not on our side.

[0:08:13]  In fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic, it's

[0:08:19]  that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call to get ready.

[0:08:25]  If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic.

[0:08:30]  Thank you.

[0:08:31]  Applause
