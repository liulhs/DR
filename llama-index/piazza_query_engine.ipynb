      "It appears that many of you are experiencing connectivity issues with instances deployed on AWS. As you may have already guessed, any misconfiguration within the series of complex settings from the creation of your remote instances to the ssh can lead to connection failures. Here are some potential reasons I've identified, including issues that previous students encountered during my office hours, which I hope will assist you:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Ensure that you are using Ubuntu 20 and the VyOS rolling version (I used rolling 1.3, but version 1.3.3 should work as well).\n",

      "*   Verify that your VPC's route tables are set to \"main\" and the target is set to \"any (0.0.0.0/0)\"\n",
      "    \n",
      "*   Check if your security rules allow TCP requests from any network.\n",
      "    \n",
      "*   Review the network (subnet) topology to ensure that each instance is configured correctly.\n",
      "    \n",
      "*   Confirm whether the Elastic IP is correctly associated with the intended interface.\n",
      "    \n",
      "*   Double-check your SSH key and the connection method (use the connection command copied from the \"Connect\" page on the website).\n",
      "    \n",
      "*   **If you suspect that you cannot connect to the remote host due to issues with the remote operating system, there's a way to confirm your suspicion. Instead of using an Elastic IP, assign a public IP directly to a specific port when creating the EC2 instance, and then check if you can SSH/ping into it. If you can, it suggests that the issue is not related to the system.**\n",
      "    \n",
      "*   **If you cannot SSH into the software router using a public IP, you can try connecting to the software router (10.0.2.x?) using an internal SSH connection from either the client or server side to troubleshoot your connectivity issues. For example, if you cannot ssh vyos@PublicIP from your laptop, then try ssh vyos@PrivateIP from client or server using nested ssh.**\n",

      "I appreciate your persistence so far. In the first week, we familiarized ourselves with using local virtual machines to simulate network communication with the help of a Hypervisor. This week, we are attempting to deploy the core elements of Experiment 1 onto AWS. AWS's EC2 is an excellent and typical example of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in cloud computing (EE555 will cover related theories). Although we are essentially doing the same thing in these two experiments, the AWS configuration introduces various miscellaneous issues (perhaps the AWS internal software router is similar to VyOS). I'm sorry that I cannot individually review and debug for each person, but all I can do is speculate on potential issues, and I apologize for that. You are encouraged to check your settings with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to these challenges, personally, I prefer Oracle Cloud, which is both free and user-friendly. It lacks many features I rarely use and is easier to configure. However, large companies are primarily using AWS now, so perhaps familiarity with AWS is more beneficial for job prospects? In the first two experiments, we learned how to configure virtual machines proficiently (maybe that's all we did?). In the upcoming experiments, we will make the most of them, as AWS can provide much more computational power than local setups. This will allow us to embark on more meaningful projects, with fewer of the miscellaneous issues we encountered in the first two experiments.\n",

      "Answer: Here are a few suggestions:1. You should check if the router table of your VPC is set to \"main\" (create a new route table, adding 0.0.0.0, and in \"actions\", click set main route table).2. If you change your configuration anytime, you might need to try re-binding the elastic IP to another n/i on vyOS.3.

As you may have already guessed, any misconfiguration within the series of complex settings from the creation of your remote instances to the ssh can lead to connection failures. Here are some potential reasons I\\'ve identified, including issues that previous students encountered during my office hours, which I hope will assist you:\\n\\n*   Ensure that you are using Ubuntu 20 and the VyOS rolling version (I used rolling 1.3, but version 1.3.3 should work as well).\\n    \\n*   Verify that your VPC\\'s route tables are set to \"main\" and the target is set to \"any (0.0.0.0/0)\"\\n    \\n*   Check if your security rules allow TCP requests from any network.\\n    \\n*   Review the network (subnet) topology to ensure that each instance is configured correctly.\\n    \\n*   Confirm whether the Elastic IP is correctly associated with the intended interface.\\n    \\n*   Double-check your SSH key and the connection method (use the connection command copied from the \"Connect\" page on the website).\\n    \\n*   **If you suspect that you cannot connect to the remote host due to issues with the remote operating system, there\\'s a way to confirm your suspicion. Instead of using an Elastic IP, assign a public IP directly to a specific port when creating the EC2 instance, and then check if you can SSH/ping into it. If you can, it suggests that the issue is not related to the system.**\\n    \\n*   **If you cannot SSH into the software router using a public IP, you can try connecting to the software router (10.0.2.x?) using an internal SSH connection from either the client or server side to troubleshoot your connectivity issues. For example, if you cannot ssh vyos@PublicIP from your laptop, then try ssh vyos@PrivateIP from client or server using nested ssh.**\\n    \\n\\nI appreciate your persistence so far. In the first week, we familiarized ourselves with using local virtual machines to simulate network communication with the help of a Hypervisor. This week, we are attempting to deploy the core elements of Experiment 1 onto AWS. AWS\\'s EC2 is an excellent and typical example of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in cloud computing (EE555 will cover related theories). Although we are essentially doing the same thing in these two experiments, the AWS configuration introduces various miscellaneous issues (perhaps the AWS internal software router is similar to VyOS). I\\'m sorry that I cannot individually review and debug for each person, but all I can do is speculate on potential issues, and I apologize for that. You are encouraged to check your settings with each other.\\n\\nDue to these challenges, personally, I prefer Oracle Cloud, which is both free and user-friendly. It lacks many features I rarely use and is easier to configure. However, large companies are primarily using AWS now, so perhaps familiarity with AWS is more beneficial for job prospects? In the first two experiments, we learned how to configure virtual machines proficiently (maybe that\\'s all we did?). In the upcoming experiments, we will make the most of them, as AWS can provide much more computational power than local setups. This will allow us to embark on more meaningful projects, with fewer of the miscellaneous issues we encountered in the first two experiments.\\n\\nContext Chunk 1:\\nfilename: /home/jason/coursistant/DR/txt/question.txt\\nretrieval_score: 0.7533819370971339\\n\\n=P\\n\\nThe reason why the professor said you have to delete \\'one\\' to add \\'the other\\' is that the two rules in the provided command are both added to the **\\'root\\'** position of the chain and they are conflicted.\\n\\nBut of course you should add them both in some way, namely in this way:\\n\\n```shell\\nrules chain (parent -> handle):\\nroot -> rule 1 -> rule 2 -> ...\\n```\\n\\nYou may want to understand this:\\n\\n```shell\\n# see: root -> rule 1 -> rule 2\\n\\nsudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: netem delay 100ms\\nsudo tc qdisc add dev eth0 parent 1: handle 2: tbf rate 10mbit latency 1ms burst 90155 limit 2000000\\n```\\n\\nQuestion: When I am running \"sudo cat /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max\". I am getting error as \"cat: /proc/sys/net/core/rmex_max: No such file or directory\".Since I am using Ubuntu on MacOS, is this issue due to this fact?Please let me know how I can resolve this issue.Thanks in advance.\\nAnswer: Yes, that\\'s probably the reason. Please use AWS EC2 to do the Lab.\\n\\nQuestion: For this lab, can we write three case-specific programs that implement different algorithms, or we should write a generic program that should be used across different cases?\\nAnswer: Two programs for all the cases. One for server (in all situations), the other for client ( in all situations).\\n\\nQuestion: For Lab4, can we use instance with larger memory or better CPU?\\nAnswer: Yes. Make sure the bottom neck of your network will not be your virtual machines.\\n\\nQuestion: Hi guys,\\nI met a problem hard to understand while deploying topology network on aws vpc.\\nthe environment configuration\\n1)client located in 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 with its primary interface 10.0.1.0/24\\n2)router located in 10.0.2.0/24 and 10.0.3.0/24 with its primary interface 10.0.3.0/24\\n3)server located in 10.0.3.0/24 and 10.0.4.0/24 with its primary interface 10.0.4.0/24\\n4)all subnets are connected to the default router with one internet gateway and one for all the local address\\nthe problem is that I can ping from client to 10.0.3.56 while 10.0.3.0/24 does not appear either in client\\'s ARP nor routing table \\nin addition, after I add sudo ip route 10.0.3.0/24 via 10.0.2.60(interface on the router), the traffic from client to server will pass 10.0.2.60\\nDoes anyone know why this problem happens?\\nAnswer: > the problem is that I can ping from client to 10.0.3.56 while 10.0.3.0/24 does not appear either in client\\'s ARP nor routing table\\n\\nI am not sure if you are asking since your laptop and Google\\'s servers are on different networks, you should not be able to ping Google?\\n\\nQuestion: for Lab 4, should the start time be the moment the sender open the file, or should it be the moment the sender start to send file through the internet?For the end time, should it be the moment the file is fully written to the disk, or should it be the moment the entire file is received and ordered, but writting file is not finished yet?\\nAnswer: Measure the time from `start to send` to `finish sending`. And also check md5sum. Maybe you want to read the whole file before start sending instead of reading and sending at the same time.\\n\\nQuestion: Hi everyone, I am wondering for the submission of lab 4 report and video, is it enough for one person in the group to submit? Or does everyone in the group need to submit? Thanks.\\nAnswer: One submission each team.\\n\\nQuestion: Please give information on what kit and products needed to be purchased for this class.
