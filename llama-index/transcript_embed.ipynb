The documents also discussed the history and applications of machine learning, including recognizing flowers, handwritten zip codes, and social media recognition. Additionally, the PDFs covered different flavors of learning problems like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The focus of the course mentioned in the PDFs is on supervised learning before the midterm and unsupervised learning after the midterm.\n",

In the context of machine learning, linear regression can be used to predict future temperatures by analyzing historical temperature data. By fitting a linear model to the data, we can identify trends and patterns in temperature variations over time.\n",
