            "content": "**Sorry about my ignorance as I just realized that some of you were just enrolled officially in the class and did not receive the email I sent you via Blackboard on Tuesday. FYI, here is the email:**\n\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI am Yude Wei. I am privileged to be your course mentor for EE542 in Fall 2023. This is a brief note that may give you some tips on how to succeed in this class.\n\n**Your First Week**\n\nAs mentioned in yesterday's lecture, EE542 should be a lab based course and you may have to spend much time on your labs even from the first week.\n\nThe lab for the first week is mainly about Network Testing and Simulation between Virtual Machines to help you better understand Network Communication. You need to set up a bunch of Virtual Machine Instances to let them communicate with each other in different situations using Hypervisor. See\u00a0[https://blackboard.usc.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content\\_id=\\_9847668\\_1&course\\_id=\\_323861\\_1](https://blackboard.usc.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_9847668_1&course_id=_323861_1)\u00a0.\n\nThis is a quite easy lab where you can just follow the instructions and finish everything, especially if you just took EE450 recently and still remember what we did in the final project to set up the environment. But there may still be many miscellaneous issues while proceeding, and please feel free to reach out to me if so.\n\nAlso, as learning how to set up the environment is not quite a negligible part in the first week's lab, I want to remind you that please\u00a0**choose the command-line version of Linux system to install**\u00a0instead of the one with GUI (as we don't need the GUI), or else your laptop could be a little stuck or running out of memory.\n\n**My Office Hours**\n\n**My open office hours this week dedicated to EE542 are from 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday (today), and from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday at SSL 208 in person.**\u00a0FYI, see\u00a0[https://libraries.usc.edu/locations/science-engineering-library](https://libraries.usc.edu/locations/science-engineering-library)\u00a0.\n\nPlease be noticed that this is just a\u00a0**tentative**\u00a0arrangement and it may change based on your other course selection. I should be in the same room from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and you can come at any time you want, but I will be mainly focusing on severing the students from EE599 (Monday session) and EE538 during other time slots as I am also working as one of the course staff for those two classes.\n\nIf the time above is still conflicted with your other classes, please always feel free to send me emails at\u00a0**[yudewei@usc.edu](mailto:yudewei@usc.edu)**\u00a0for any questions or Zoom meeting appointment. But please also understand that I may not be able to reply very soon as I could also need some time to debug your situation, so please\u00a0**do not wait until the last minute to ask your questions**.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\nThough the first lab should be done by your own (without teammates), you may start to find your teammates even from now so that you could know if he/she will suit you well as you will be working together on so many labs through the whole semester and you will get\u00a0**overwhelmed**\u00a0if your teammates never do anything.\n\nIf you plan to register for 2 classes during this semester, I would like to remind you to select a relatively easier course to be the other one, and what I did is to select\u00a0**EE555**\u00a0last year. That is a course mainly talking about the theory in detail like Hypervisor, EGP, Tunneling and Queuing Model, etc. and\u00a0**very well complements the lab based EE542**. EE538 is also a relatively easier class where you can learn some programming basics that are helpful in EE542. EE599 (by Prof. Arash Saifhashemi) is also a good choice for you to learn about ML. Anyways, EE542 is a rather worth taking class where you should put in enough effort and will learn a lot of things and hopefully you could spend your time well.\n\nI was working as a mentor for EE538 and a grader for EE552 last semester and also working as a DR student under Prof. Young Cho on an IIoT project based on what I learned from EE542 last year. I think I am trained well to work as a course staff and be familiar with the course materials, so please do feel free to come to me if you have any questions even on the final project.\n\nHope you will enjoy the class and have a fruitful semester.\n\nBest regards,\n\nYude Wei",

            "content": "Dear all,\n\nIt appears that many of you are experiencing connectivity issues with instances deployed on AWS. As you may have already guessed, any misconfiguration within the series of complex settings from the creation of your remote instances to the ssh can lead to connection failures. Here are some potential reasons I've identified, including issues that previous students encountered during my office hours, which I hope will assist you:\n\n*   Ensure that you are using Ubuntu 20 and the VyOS rolling version (I used rolling 1.3, but version 1.3.3 should work as well).\n    \n*   Verify that your VPC's route tables are set to \"main\" and the target is set to \"any (0.0.0.0/0)\"\n    \n*   Check if your security rules allow TCP requests from any network.\n    \n*   Review the network (subnet) topology to ensure that each instance is configured correctly.\n    \n*   Confirm whether the Elastic IP is correctly associated with the intended interface.\n    \n*   Double-check your SSH key and the connection method (use the connection command copied from the \"Connect\" page on the website).\n    \n*   **If you suspect that you cannot connect to the remote host due to issues with the remote operating system, there's a way to confirm your suspicion. Instead of using an Elastic IP, assign a public IP directly to a specific port when creating the EC2 instance, and then check if you can SSH/ping into it. If you can, it suggests that the issue is not related to the system.**\n    \n*   **If you cannot SSH into the software router using a public IP, you can try connecting to the software router (10.0.2.x?) using an internal SSH connection from either the client or server side to troubleshoot your connectivity issues. For example, if you cannot ssh vyos@PublicIP from your laptop, then try ssh vyos@PrivateIP from client or server using nested ssh.**\n    \n\nI appreciate your persistence so far. In the first week, we familiarized ourselves with using local virtual machines to simulate network communication with the help of a Hypervisor. This week, we are attempting to deploy the core elements of Experiment 1 onto AWS. AWS's EC2 is an excellent and typical example of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in cloud computing (EE555 will cover related theories). Although we are essentially doing the same thing in these two experiments, the AWS configuration introduces various miscellaneous issues (perhaps the AWS internal software router is similar to VyOS). I'm sorry that I cannot individually review and debug for each person, but all I can do is speculate on potential issues, and I apologize for that. You are encouraged to check your settings with each other.\n\nDue to these challenges, personally, I prefer Oracle Cloud, which is both free and user-friendly. It lacks many features I rarely use and is easier to configure. However, large companies are primarily using AWS now, so perhaps familiarity with AWS is more beneficial for job prospects? In the first two experiments, we learned how to configure virtual machines proficiently (maybe that's all we did?). In the upcoming experiments, we will make the most of them, as AWS can provide much more computational power than local setups. This will allow us to embark on more meaningful projects, with fewer of the miscellaneous issues we encountered in the first two experiments.",

I thought that would due to the way iperf3 measure bandwidth between client and server. If the bandwidth is too small, client would not be able to send packet to the server. So the result turned out to be 0.In addition, if we add delay to the interface, there will be smaller speed. That is because additional delay on the interface speed down returning bandwidth.\n\nIf there is anything wrong above, please correct me.",
