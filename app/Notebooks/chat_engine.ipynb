      "Answer: This course is an introduction to machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence. It is designed to be practical and focuses on making predictions or decisions that improve with experience. The course covers different types of learning problems, including supervised learning, classification problems, regression problems, and unsupervised learning. It also discusses the challenges of problems that are difficult to describe explicitly, such as face detection or movie preference prediction.\n",

      "Answer: The dimensionality of the input can be reduced using techniques like Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These techniques help in compressing the data and describing it using fewer values. For example, if we have a vector of 500 stock price changes, instead of describing it with 500 real values per day, we can explore the structure of the data and use fewer values to describe most of the changes in the prices. This can be achieved by designing an algorithm that can tell which elements of the data vector are changing together and exploit that to describe them using only a smaller number of real values.\n",

      "Answer: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where training data with correct answers is provided. It involves prediction problems in which we're given examples of what our function should output in a number of instances, taken in the form of training data with input features and labeled desired output values. On the other hand, unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the goal is to understand the data and its structure without a specific signal to predict. Using only these kinds of data, unsupervised learning techniques can organize the data automatically.\n",
